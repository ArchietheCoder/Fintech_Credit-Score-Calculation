Credit Score Calculation
Overview
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing basic customer details and extensive credit-related information.
The goal is to conduct a strategic exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model-driven hypothetical credit score calculation. 
Insights gained from this analysis aim to reveal factors influencing creditworthiness and guide potential risk mitigation strategies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Thoroughly understand data characteristics, distributions, and relationships.
Detect and address null values, data type mismatches, inconsistencies, and outliers.
Utilize appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) for pattern discovery.

Feature Engineering:
Create informative features based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA.
Aggregate data on the customer level when necessary.

Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation:
Develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score using relevant features.
Clearly outline the methodology, providing detailed explanations inspired by industry credit score models.
Scaling and Standarization of the features
Explore different weighting schemes for feature contributions.
